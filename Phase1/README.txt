					implemenation, process structure, and

Notes:
   
	-	USLOSS not included

	-	The compiler does not like the statusQueue argument in our 
		AddProcessLL() function. However, it still compiles. The 
		format is used to compare memory addresses. Our attempts
		to eliminate these warnings negated necessary code.
   
	-	My CPU is very fast so some of the output is slightly different. 
	
		-	test05: used the updated test case from D2L
		-	test26: added 2 zeros to the loop 
		-	all other test cases are ran as is
